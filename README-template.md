## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

That practice makes perfect.
this is how I would have done it before with margin and text center
a more simple solution would have been this:

``` html
<div class="card">
    <img src="assets\imgs\image-qr-code.png">
    <h3>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h3>
    <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </div>
```
```css
.card {
	padding: 12px;
	background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
	border-radius: 15px;
	margin-top: 150px;
	width: 270px;
	margin: 0 auto;
	text-align: center;
}
```

### Continued development

Continue practicing different layouts.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helps me when I forget flexbox elements. I like how easy it is to follow.
